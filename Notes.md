# Notes
## Usage Ideas of AI
- Find out proper sink and sources for the binary we analyse, could even write the yaml definiition for missing source/sinks
- Help identify potential inputs, hint the analyst on how to trigger the path
- Fix the import type definition (multiple times I had the source/sink imports not having proper parameters defined)
#### ChatGPT Question:

I have the following Binary Ninja Medium Level IL output:
```
 8 @ +0x04a0  r0_1#4 = &var_48
 9 @ +0x04a8  mem#3 = snprintf(str: r0_1#4, size: 0x40, format: "%s", r3#1) @ mem#1
10 @ +0x04ac  r0_2#5 = &var_48
11 @ +0x04b0  r0_3#6, mem#4 = system(command: r0_2#5) @ mem#3
12 @ +0x04b0  goto 13 @ 0x104b8
```
Can you explain me the meaning of mem#3?

#### ChatGPT Answer:

In Binary Ninja's Medium Level IL (MLIL), `mem#N` represents a memory versioning system used to track changes to memory throughout the program. Each unique `mem#N` refers to a different state of memory at a given point in execution.

##### Explanation of `mem#3` in Your MLIL Output:
1. **Before `mem#3` is introduced:**
   - At instruction **8**, `r0_1#4 = &var_48` stores the address of `var_48` into `r0_1#4`.
   - This means `r0_1#4` will be used as a pointer to `var_48`.
2. **Instruction 9: `mem#3 = snprintf(...) @ mem#1`**
   - This means `snprintf` writes into memory, modifying it.
   - `mem#1` represents the state of memory before `snprintf` executes.
   - `mem#3` represents the new state of memory after `snprintf` executes.
   - This suggests that `snprintf` modified `var_48`, since `r0_1#4` (which points to `var_48`) was passed as its first argument.
3. **Instruction 11: `system(command: r0_2#5) @ mem#3`**
   - `system` is executed using `r0_2#5`, which is also `&var_48`.
   - Since this happens at `mem#3`, it means `system` is using the modified contents of `var_48`, which was written by `snprintf`.
##### Why is This Important?
The memory versioning system helps Binary Ninja (and you) track how memory is modified over time. Specifically:
- `mem#1` is the memory state before `snprintf`.
- `mem#3` is the state after `snprintf` modifies memory.
- `mem#4` is the state after `system` executes.
##### Security Implication:
- This looks like a potential **command injection vulnerability**, where user-controlled data (`r3#1`) is used in `snprintf`, and the resulting string is executed by `system`. If `r3#1` is attacker-controlled, this could allow arbitrary command execution.
